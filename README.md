ClusterGrowthMetrics

To run the cluster growth metrics script *metrics_all_clusters.R* from within R, first run *env_setup.R* in a new R project, and then move the data files you would like to use into the newly created *data* directory. Edit the filename variables near the top of the *metrics_all_clusters.R* script, and then run *source("metrics_all_clusters.R")*.
